#### School of Computing Science, University of East Anglia
---
The task is to design a website for an independent hotel. It should include images of the hotel, room rates,
a description of the facilities, directions to get there, contact details, local activities and attractions. You
do not need to implement any booking facilities in this assignment. You should include facilities (an
electronic visitor book) to allow comments to be left.
Your design should envisage an important use the site is to be linked to and from a hotel booking agency.
The site should work well on mobile devices.

  - 1. Core functionality:
(a) A gallery capable of displaying thumbnails and larger images;
(b) Descriptions of the hotel and of facilities of the local area;
(c) Pages to read and display comments.
  - 2. Additional functionality:
When you have completed the core functionality listed above, you can add facilities dynamically create
and modify content using JavaScript. For instance, if you have stored the image captions as the alt text in
the <img> tag, this can be retrieved and displayed with JavaScript. Much more is possible and your task
in this section is to make good use of HTML5 capabilities, combined with JavaScript to give a good user
experience. 
  - 3. Documentation:
(a) Good quality comments in your code;
(b) A review, including suitable screen shots, etc. of similar sites which have feature which you have
found helpful or influential (negative or positive) in your design;
(c) A description of the tests done on different browsers and mobile devices (max. 2 sides);
(d) A description of the main design decisions and limitations of your site, primarily aimed at future
developers or maintainers of the site
  - 4. All the HTML code must be validated to HTML5, with all the style elements in external CSS stylesheets
(any in-line style tags or formatting attributes will be penalised); the JavaScript needed for the third part
of the assignment should all be in external scripts.

# Notes

I decided to try and use Git (and GitHub) during my courseworks in order to get more accustomed to the revision/versioning system. During my next projects and courseworks, I will try to make better assumptions and comments during my commits.
